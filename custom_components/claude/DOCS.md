# Claude

Run Home Assistant's conversation agent and AI Tasks on your **Claude
subscription** instead of a pay-per-token Anthropic API key. The integration
drives the Claude Agent SDK **in-process** (the SDK bundles the Claude Code CLI,
`claude -p`) and mirrors the stock Anthropic integration feature-for-feature.

## How it works

```
Assist / AI Task
      │  (conversation entity, streaming)
claude integration        ── in-process, inside Home Assistant
      │  Claude Agent SDK (query) ── bundled claude CLI subprocess
      │  in-process MCP server "ha"  ← HA LLM tools, executed directly
your Claude subscription
```

- Home Assistant builds the prompt and exposes the selected LLM API tools (e.g.
  Assist) to the model as an in-process MCP server (`mcp__ha__*`).
- The agent loop runs inside Home Assistant. When Claude calls an HA tool, the
  integration executes it **directly** via the conversation's LLM API — no
  round-trip, respecting your exposed entities exactly like the stock
  integration. Tool calls and results are still recorded in the chat log.
- Conversations map to Claude sessions (`resume`), so multi-turn context is
  kept across turns; after a Home Assistant restart the prior transcript is
  folded into the system prompt instead.

## Setup

**Settings → Devices & services → Add integration → Claude.** The first time
you submit credentials the integration downloads the Claude Code CLI matching
your platform (~250 MB, cached under `/config`), so allow a few minutes. Then
pick one of:

### Log in with Claude (recommended)

Open the link the flow shows, approve access, and paste the code back. Home
Assistant notifies you before the login expires, and again if it does.

### Enter a token or API key manually

- **OAuth token** — from `claude setup-token` (the `sk-ant-oat01-...` value).
- **API key** — an Anthropic API key, used only when no OAuth token is set.

Credentials are verified with a minimal query before the entry is created. Change
them later via the integration's **Reconfigure**.

The integration creates a conversation agent (with Assist control enabled) and
an AI Task entity. Add more, or reconfigure options (model, thinking, web search,
web fetch, code execution), from the integration's subentries.

## Options (per subentry)

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| Model | Model for responses. "Account default" uses your Claude default. |
| Maximum tokens | Cap on response tokens per turn. |
| Thinking budget | Extended-thinking token budget (0 = model decides). |
| Thinking effort | Effort level (default/low/medium/high/xhigh/max). |
| Code execution | Allow Bash / file tools in a scratch workspace inside HA. |
| Web search / Web fetch | Enable Claude's WebSearch / WebFetch tools. |
| Include home location | Localize web search to your home location. |

Credentials (OAuth token / API key) live on the integration entry itself and are
changed via **Reconfigure** or the reauth prompt.

## Feature mapping vs. the Anthropic integration

| Anthropic integration | Claude |
|---|---|
| API key | Claude subscription (OAuth token) or API key |
| Model selection | Same (aliases + custom value) |
| Assist / LLM API tools | Same (executed in-process) |
| Streaming responses | Same |
| Extended thinking budget / effort | Same (`thinking`, `effort`) |
| Web search / web fetch | Claude WebSearch / WebFetch tools |
| Code execution | Claude Bash/file tools, in a scratch workspace |
| Attachments (images, PDF) | Same |
| AI Task structured output | Native JSON-schema output |
| Prompt caching strategy | Managed automatically by Claude |
| Per-tool max uses | Not available (bounded by max turns instead) |

## Known limitations

- Latency is higher than the raw API: each turn spins the Claude agent
  loop. Expect a few seconds; noticeable on voice.
- Headless runs consume the Agent SDK credit pool of your subscription; when
  exhausted, requests fail until it resets (or configure an API key).
- The CLI is fetched for your platform (`linux-arm64`/`linux-x64`, glibc or
  musl) from Anthropic's release server on first setup; it needs outbound
  internet and ~250 MB free under `/config`.
- Code execution runs inside the Home Assistant process, as root; leave it off
  unless you trust the exposed conversation.
- Citations are not surfaced.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Claude has no valid credentials"** / **"401 Invalid authentication
  credentials"** — the login expired or was revoked. Reconfigure the integration
  and log in again.
- **Setup hangs on first install** — the `claude-agent-sdk` wheel is large; give
  it time, and check Home Assistant has outbound internet for pip.
- **Model errors** — leave the model on "Account default" or pick one your
  subscription can access.
- Set the `claude` logger to `debug` to see the full event flow and the
  CLI's stderr.
